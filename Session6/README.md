### Session 5 Assignment ###
1. Objective 1 - Create 3 versions of best model from last assignment. Version 1 should implement Layer Normalisation. Version 2 should implement Group Normalisation. Version 3 should implement Batch + L1 Normalisation.
2. Objective 2 - Create a model file that takes Normalisation Flag as an argument. The normalisation flag can have either one of these values - Batch/Layer/Group/All. The model file 
applies the normalisation technique/techniques to the model based on Normalisation flag passed by user. Once done, execute the model file for all the 3 normalisation techniques 
and record following items:
    1. Test Loss and Test Accuracy graphs
    2. Misclassified images

### Files Created in Response to Objective 1
We created 3 files titled - [BatchNorm_L1.ipynb](https://github.com/siddharthvij10/EVA6/blob/dev_unpublished/Session6/Objective1/BatchNorm_L1.ipynb), [GroupNorm.ipynb](https://github.com/siddharthvij10/EVA6/blob/dev_unpublished/Session6/Objective1/GroupNorm.ipynb) and [LayerNorm.ipynb](https://github.com/siddharthvij10/EVA6/blob/dev_unpublished/Session6/Objective1/LayerNorm.ipynb) placed in folder [Objective1](https://github.com/siddharthvij10/EVA6/tree/dev_unpublished/Session6/Objective1)

### Files Created in Response to Objective 1
We have created 4 files titled - BN.py, LN.py, GN.py and model.py that are placed in folder Objective2.

### Findings from the normalization techniques

####Train and Test Accuracy of 3 models built are:
1. Batch Norm - Params =  :Train Accuracy =  , Test Accuracy = 
2. Layer Norm - Params =  :Train Accuracy = , Test Accuracy = 
3. Group Norm - Params =  :Train Accuracy =  , Test Accuracy =

####Performance Comparison: - TODO
1. GN
2. LN
3. BN
4. Hence the performance of the regularisation based on this esperiment is - 

### All Graphs

### Collection of Misclassified images
